In this project, 
1) a set of circles with constant radius are placed 
randomly on a rectangle. We check whether the triangle is fully 
covered by the cirlces. That is each point in the rectangle is 
inside one of the circles. We solve this issue using Voronoi
diagrams.

2) We modify the radius of the circles in a way such that all 
poitns are covered.

3) We generate random targets in the triangle. 

4) We find a set of circles that cover  all targets. 

5) if k is the size of the set cover, and r is the number of 
of circles required, then we add an additional r-k circles on 
random positions. This allows to generate a set of r circles that
cover all targets in a given rectangle.
